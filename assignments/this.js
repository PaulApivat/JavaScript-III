/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding: Absence an object, "this" will reference Window which is at the highest level
* 2. Implicit Binding: When "this" is within an object, it references that object
* 3. New Binding: When calling 'new', you're creating a new instance of a class, 'this' references that class
* 4. Explicit Binding: When using .call .apply .bind to bind objects to functions
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
